## Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing in R
### The basic process to analyze datasets using R:
- Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data
- Visualize the data
- Perform statisical tests, create regression models
- Interpret the results

### A Detailed Look Ahead
- Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using **tidyverse** in R.
- Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using **ggplot2**.
- Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using **ggplot2**.
- Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
- Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
- Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
- Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
- Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
- Identify key characteristics of **A/B testing**.
- Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

### Benefits of R
- Versatile and extensible programming language with many benefits
- Scripts are written in plaintext
- Versions of plaintext files are easy to control using tools such as Git
- R analysis scripts (or RScripts) are highly reproducible and easy to share with peers and collaborators
- Process of loading in a dataset, visualizing the data, and performing statistical tests is straightforward and easy to interpret
- Many useful data transformation and modelling libraries, such as the tidyverse package, that simplify the process of ETL and visualizations

### RStudio Integrated Development Environment
- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used to help design and test RScripts
- RStudio provides users a graphical user interface (GUI) with multiple dynamic windows and perpetual access to their RScript and R console
- RStudio enables users to test their analysis scripts line by line while allowing users to view different environment variables and outputs
- This means that for each line of code written and executed, users can verify the results and troubleshoot any problems quickly and easily

## Install R
- We must first install R before installing RStudio
- This way, RStudio can easily find our R installation while being configured
- Otherwise, we would have to manually tell RStudio where to find our installed applications

### - Install R on macOS or Windows
- Navigate to R's Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) server ([Links to an external site.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)) and select a mirror link near our region.
